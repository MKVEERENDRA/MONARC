    ## üåü Problem Statement
    
    The NFT ecosystem currently faces a critical challenge with royalty enforcement and dynamic pricing. Despite creators setting royalty percentages during NFT minting, these rates:
    
    - Are frequently bypassed by marketplaces
    - Remain static regardless of market conditions
    - Can't adapt to cross-chain sales
    - Lead to approximately $1.8B in lost royalties annually
    
    Traditional smart contracts lack the capability to:
    
    - Monitor cross-chain sales autonomously
    - Adjust royalty rates based on real-time market conditions
    - Enforce royalties across different marketplaces
    - Provide creators with transparent tracking of their earnings
    
    ## üí° Solution: Reactive Smart Contracts (RSCs)
    
    Our solution leverages the power of Reactive Smart Contracts to create a dynamic, self-adjusting royalty system that operates autonomously across multiple chains.
    
    ### Why Reactive Smart Contracts?
    
    Traditional smart contracts are passive - they only execute when directly called. RSCs, however, can:
    
    - Autonomously monitor blockchain events
    - Self-trigger functions based on market conditions
    - Operate seamlessly across multiple chains
    - Maintain consistent state across networks
    
    This makes them perfect for solving the NFT royalty problem, as they can:
    
    1. Actively monitor sales across different chains
    2. Automatically adjust royalty rates based on market conditions
    3. Enforce royalty payments across marketplaces
    4. Provide real-time tracking and distribution of royalties
    
    ## üèó Architecture
    
    Our system operates across two networks (Sepolia and Kopli) with four main reactive components:
    
    ### Core Smart Contracts
    
    1. **DynamicRoyaltyNFT Contract** (`[CONTRACT_ADDRESS_1]`)
        - Manages NFT minting and transfers
        - Implements ERC721 and ERC2981 standards
        - Handles dynamic royalty calculation and distribution
    2. **RoyaltyRegistry Contract** (`[CONTRACT_ADDRESS_2]`)
        - Stores royalty configurations
        - Calculates dynamic rates based on market conditions
        - Manages beneficiary information
    3. **MarketMonitor Contract** (`[CONTRACT_ADDRESS_3]`)
        - Tracks real-time market metrics
        - Provides data for rate calculations
        - Maintains historical price data
    4. **WrappedNFTOnKopli Contract** (`[CONTRACT_ADDRESS_4]`)
        - Manages cross-chain NFT operations
        - Handles REACT token mechanisms
        - Processes cross-chain purchases
    
    ### Reactive Components
    
    1. **Sepolia to Kopli Reactive (STK)**
        - Monitors: TokenLocked, TokenListed, TokenUnlisted events
        - Chain IDs: Sepolia (11155111) ‚Üí Kopli (5318008)
        - Transaction Hash: `[TXN_HASH_1]`
    2. **Kopli to Sepolia Reactive (KTS)**
        - Monitors: TokensLocked events
        - Chain IDs: Kopli (5318008) ‚Üí Sepolia (11155111)
        - Transaction Hash: `[TXN_HASH_2]`
    
    ## üîÑ Process Flow
    
    1. **NFT Creation & Listing**
        
        ```
        Creator ‚Üí DynamicRoyaltyNFT.mint() ‚Üí RoyaltyRegistry.setConfig()
        ‚Üì
        MarketMonitor.initializeMetrics()
        
        ```
        
        Transaction Hash: `[TXN_HASH_3]`
        
    2. **Cross-Chain Listing**
        
        ```
        Seller ‚Üí WrappedNFTOnKopli.lockTokens()
        ‚Üì
        KTS ‚Üí DynamicRoyaltyNFT.sendNFTToKopli()
        ‚Üì
        STK ‚Üí WrappedNFTOnKopli.mint()
        
        ```
        
        Transaction Hash: `[TXN_HASH_4]`
        
    3. **Dynamic Rate Calculation**
        
        ```
        MarketMonitor.getMetrics()
        ‚Üì
        RoyaltyRegistry.calculateRate()
        ‚Üì
        DynamicRoyaltyNFT.updateRoyalty()
        
        ```
        
        Transaction Hash: `[TXN_HASH_5]`
